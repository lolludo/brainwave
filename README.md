# NEXUS: Next-gen Education eXperience for University Students

**"The Smart Centralized Brain for Your University Life"**

NEXUS is an intelligent, AI-powered platform designed to streamline the academic lives of university students (specifically tailored for DTU). It integrates multiple AI agents to handle scheduling, content organization, study planning, and real-time query resolution, creating a cohesive "smart brain" for students.

## 🧠 System Architecture & Workflow

NEXUS utilizes a hybrid AI architecture, leveraging **Google Gemini** for high-precision document analysis and **OnDemand** for specialized media processing and conversational agents.

## 🚀 Key Features & AI Integration

### 1. Smart Timetable Scanner (Powered by Gemini)
- **What it does:** Users upload an image of their college timetable.
- **How it works:** A specialized **Genkit Flow** (`timetable-analysis`) uses **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro** to visually scan the image, extracting:
    - Subject Names (e.g., "Computer Networks", "DBMS")
    - Exact Class Schedules (Day, Time, Location)
- **Benefit:** Eliminates manual entry. Instantly populates the **Daily Planner** and **Attendance Tracker**.

### 2. Intelligent Auto-Classification
- **What it does:** When you upload scattered notes (PDFs, images, handwritten pages), NEXUS automatically files them into the correct subject folder.
- **How it works:** The **Classification Agent** reads the document content, compares it against your parsed `Subjects List`, and moves the file to the appropriate directory (e.g., `Notes/DBMS/Unit1.pdf`).

### 3. Media Analysis (Powered by OnDemand)
- **What it does:** Watch less, learn more. Paste a YouTube lecture link, and NEXUS extracts the knowledge for you.
- **flow:**
    1.  **Ingestion:** YouTube Video $\rightarrow$ **OnDemand Media API** (`plugin-1713961903`).
    2.  **Processing:** Video is transcribed into text asynchronously.
    3.  **Reasoning:** The transcript is fed into the **OnDemand Chat API**, allowing you to ask specific questions ("Is backpropagation explained?") and get factual YES/NO answers with evidence.

### 4. DTU Smart Bot (Personalized Agent)
- **What it does:** A specialized chatbot tuned for DTU (Delhi Technological University) students.
- **Tech Stack:** **OnDemand Chat Widget** (Bot ID: `6969fd7c...`).
- **Context Awareness:** It is injected with real-time context about the student:
    - Current CGPA
    - Attendance Shortfalls
    - Upcoming Exams
- **Capabilities:** Can answer queries using a knowledge base of verified university info.

### 5. Smart Planners & Trackers
- **Daily Planner:** Auto-generates your day's plan based on the parsed schedule + study backlog.
- **Attendance Tracker:** Linked directly to the subject list. Updates percentages in real-time as you mark classes. Provides "Bunk" alerts if attendance drops below 75%.
- **Study Planner:** Generates custom schedules for upcoming exams using AI to verify syllabus coverage.

### 6. Utility AI Tools
- **AI Summarizer:** Condenses long research papers or notes into digestible summaries.
- **Quiz Generator:** Creates dynamic quizzes based on your specific subjects to test knowledge retention.
- **CGPA Calculator:** Smart projection of your grades.
